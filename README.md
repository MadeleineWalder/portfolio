## Update Log

### 25/05/24
- Made navbar transparent and permanently fixed to top of page
- Fixed bug where site had a horizontal scroll bar
- Fixed bug where 'Back to Top' button stopped functioning because of navbar position changes

### 22/05/24
- Fixed problem where Contributions section is too close to the section above it on certain desktop screen sizes.
- Added 'Back to Top' button which will be especially helpful for mobile users as they have to scroll further.

## Future Improvements
- Make all text smaller on mobile devices
- Add more images & profile picture
- Change navbar font colours, should be white and go gray when hovered, not the opposite
- Make a card for each project, include a 'visit' button to go to the project and write more description about each
- Change id of back to top button href to 'home' for example instead of page top
- Add a contact form or remove contact from navbar in the mean time, OR make it more clear that the contact section is the details in the footer


## Local Hosting
